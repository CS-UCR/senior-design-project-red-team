## Overview
Researchers would like to identify trends (specifically anomalies) in flight data and be able to label it as such and export it to a separate database.

The goal of this project is to create a web application with an easy to use U.I that is fast that will allow researchers to view the data with filters and allow them to spot and label anomalies. 

Noticing and marking anomalous data is extremely important in determining any failures in both the pilot and the plane that was in the flight. It helps expose trends that may be a risk to flight safety.

## How To Run
Ensure the dependencies are met.
Then in the project directory, you can run: `node Server.js`

This will begin the server. Once the server is running, open `Client.html`. The application is now usable.
